# Contribution Guide

Before contributing, make sure you are familiar with the [code of conduct](https://github.com/daedalus-discord/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). All behavior must follow the code of conduct, including contributions and discussions around contributions.

## Preface

Except for following the code of conduct, which is required, everything else serves as a guideline and not as a strict policy you must follow. That said, following these guidelines will make contributing easier for everyone involved, so please follow them as much as is reasonable and possible.

## What to do when:

### You have a question

If you just have a question, you should ask in our support server, [The Labyrinth](https://discord.gg/7TRKfSK7EU). You will receive a much faster answer and we have other resources in the server that may help you out!

### You found a bug that isn't exploitable

Open an issue and follow the bug template. Make sure you provide steps to reproduce the bug, any context necessary to understanding the issue, screenshots where necessary, and a clear description of what you expected and what you observed. Also, be sure to have a clear issue title and check for duplicate reports of the issue.

If possible, please include the server ID where you discovered this bug. People cannot see your server's name or join your server with just the ID and anyone in the server can obtain that information, but this lets the developers look through the database for your server's configuration to identify problems.

### You found a bug that is exploitable

By exploitable, we mean anything that has potential security or privilege escalation concerns, e.g. a permission grants power to members that should not have it by default, or a bug allows someone to control the bot in a way that can be used maliciously.

If this is the case, follow our [security policy](https://github.com/daedalus-discord/.github/blob/main/SECURITY.md). Do not open an issue, as this can draw unnecessary attention to an exploitable issue.

### You have a feature request

Open an issue and follow the feature-request template. Make sure you describe in as much detail as possible what exactly you want, some context explaining why you want it and what you would use it for (so we can help enhance the feature and make sure it fits your needs), and reasonably specific details so we understand your request. Also, be sure to have a clear issue title and check for duplicate feature requests and make sure the feature doesn't already exist.

### You have a complaint

Let us know in our support server, [The Labyrinth](https://discord.gg/7TRKfSK7EU). If you don't want to open the issue publicly, feel free to DM a staff member on that server and they will keep your confidentiality with people outside the staff team.

### You want to make a pull request

Please don't open PRs on your own. If you have a bug report or feature request, please follow the steps above. If strictly necessary, make sure you clearly describe what you are changing and make sure it is mergeable and passes workflows.

## Anything else

Ask us in our support server, [The Labyrinth](https://discord.gg/7TRKfSK7EU), and we'd be happy to help you! You can ask us in the server, DM Daedalus#1821 to open a private modmail thread with staff, or DM a staff member directly.
