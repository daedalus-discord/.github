# Code of Conduct

## Pledge

We, as members, contributors, and leaders, pledge to uphold an environment free of harassment for all, regardless of personal identity, experience and education, and other statuses. We pledge to interact in ways that maintain an open, diversive, and includive community.

## Standards

We expect the following from the community and all contributors:
- Respect and decency towards everyone
- Giving and receiving constructive feedback
- Being respectful of others' opinions, experiences, and perspectives
- Focusing on what is best for the community

We denounce the following behavior:
- Any form of sexual language or imagery or sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, personal attacks, slurs, harassment, etc.
- Publishing others' personal private information without their explicit consent
- Any other conduct that can be reasonably interpreted as unprofessional or inappropriate in a public setting

## Enforcement

Community leaders are responsible for upholding our core values, clarifying our standards and expectations, and enforcing them to maintain a healthy environment. Any inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful behavior will be handled as leaders deem necessary to enforce the code of conduct, starting with corrective action but also including warnings and temporary or permanent bans from contributing ever again.

## Reporting

Instances of unacceptable behavior may be reported via The Labyrinth, our official support server on Discord, which you can join [here](https://discord.gg/7TRKfSK7EU). Simply DM **Daedalus#1821** once you are in the server to open a private thread with staff.

Community leaders must respect the privacy and security of reporting individuals and pledge to assess all reviews promptly and fairly in line with the stated expectations and requirements as well as any considerations following their own judgement of what is best for the community and all individuals.
